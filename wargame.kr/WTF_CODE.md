# WTF_CODE

## Problem
  This is another programming language.

  Can you read this source code?

## Solution
  Actually, I knew what the programming language is used. It's called whitespace since it only uses whitespace characters like ' ', '\t', and '\n'.
  Let's google for whitespace compiler and run the code.

## Flag
  I won't share my flag to you this time because the result of the code says this flag is only for my ip.
  Good luck!
